        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          My programming journey kickstarted when my elder sister was preparing for her C++ examination. 
          The 14-year-old me instantly fell in love with programming because the "C++ Calculator program" 
          And it was this very interest in computers and programming which acted as the catalyst for me 
          to pursue my higher education in Computer Science and Software Engineering.

        <h3>Game Development</h3>
        <p>
          Video Games define more than half of my childhood, I can vividly recall how excited the 8 year old me was after playing
          Contra(my first video game ever). It was an ecstatic feeling. I was so mesmerized by that first experience that my love
          for love video games is flourishing till now. This interest in games along with my interest in programming led me to pursue game
          development. And even though my experience in the industry is low, merely <strong>over a year worth of experience</strong>, I can say
          with great confidence that Game Development has been a fulfilling endeavor for me.

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          My Web Development journey started as the byproduct of my interest in programming and game dev. Back in the early days, when I was new game dev,
          I decided to track my journey by writing blog posts about various programming concepts, and game dev concepts. That is when I dabbled into web
          dev for the first time, and from that point onwards web dev has been a never-ending learning journey for me just like programming and game dev.
